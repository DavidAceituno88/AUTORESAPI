How to connect with SQL SERVER AND CREATE A DB WITH ENTITY FRAMEWORK CORE

1 You need to have your Models or Entities created and your Context created.

2 You need to have Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore intalled and added to your api project folder

3 Create a ConnectionString as follow in appsettings.json: 
 	"ConnectionStrings": {
    		"defaultConnections" : "Server=YourServerName;Database=YourDBName;Trusted_Connection=True"

4 On your Main program "program.cs" now you can create a connection :
	services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options => 
            	options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("defaultConnections")));

5 Now you can create your first Migration with the next command: dotnet ef migrations add "Name of your migration"

6 Create your database with this command : dotnet ef database update.
		This will create your db in SQL SERVER.

**Step 5 and 6 must be executed in your VSCODE Terminal, make sure you are in your projectÂ´s folder.
